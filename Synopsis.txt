SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM PROJECT BY ALMAAS ABBAS RIZVI

PROGRAM IN C TO EMULATE A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM

USES CONSOLE FOR INTERACTION DUE TO LIMITATIONS AND LACK OF GRAPHIC LIBRARIES AND OOP IN C LANGUAGE

COULD HAVE USED WIN32 BUT SCRAPPED THE IDEA DUE TO LACK OF TIME

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:-

USES <stdio.h><string.h><stdlib.h><conio.h> LIBRARIES FOR IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS USED FOR STRING MANIPULATION,SCREEN REFRESH LOOP ETC.

USES MAINLY 2 STRUCTURES:- ONE FOR USER INFO AND ONE FOR POSTS AND THEIR INFO

MAIN LOOP DISPLAY MAINLY DEPENDS ON POSTS STRUCTURE

MOST IMPORTANTLY LOGIN AND SIGNUP SYSTEM MADE USING FILE DATA RETRIEVAL SINCE THAT WAY DATA OF THE USERS IS NOT RESET WHEN PROGRAM ENDS 

STORING DATA IN FILE MAKES THE PROGRAM SESSION INDEPENDENT(DONT HAVE TO SIGNUP FOR EVERY NEW SESSION)

MAKING A NEW POST REQUIRES SIGNUP AND LOGIN

USES ASCII ART IN TXT FILES TO DISPLAY IMAGES IN PROGRAM DUE TO LACK OF GRAPHICAL CPABILITIES

DATA ABOUT POSTS COMMENTS AND LIKES IS NOT STORED IN SEPARATE FILE BECAUSE DATA WILL BE INPUT IN STRUCTURE ANYWAY THEREFORE FILE STORAGE WAS ELIMINATED FOR POSTS

THE OVERALL LENGTH OF ALL CODE IN THE PROJECT IS 1554 LINES

THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WITHIN THE COMMENTS A LOT OF ORIGINAL SCRAPED IDEAS ARE STILL PRESENT FOR REFERENCE AND POSSIBLE USE IN FUTURE VERSION IF MEMORY MANAGEMENT POSES A PROBLEM OR IF NEW FEATURES ARE NEEDED

POINTERS, ARRAYS,STRUCTURES AND FILES FORM THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE PROJECT AND ANOTHER POSSIBLE SOLUTION WITHOUT THESE SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
